# QR-Chase

QR Chase is a school project that I'm working on.

The description for the project:

In this project, we develop an outdoor paper chase game: The player is on a predefined tour and must identify with a camera certain objects or QR codes on selected locations. The duration of each run and the distance is measured and can be compared online. Multi-player functionality would be great. We recommend having access to a physical mobile device (Android or iOS).
